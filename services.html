            <h3 id="play-therapy-heading" class="section-title">Play Therapy (Children &amp; Teenagers)</h3>
            <p>Play is a child’s natural language. Through play therapy, children are given a safe and developmentally appropriate way to express thoughts, process their world, and make sense of big emotions they may not yet have words for. For older children and teens, age-appropriate activities, sand tray work, or conversation are used to help them engage in a way that feels comfortable and empowering.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Help your child feel seen, understood, and capable — recognize strengths, make sense of struggles, and learn healthy tools for daily life.</p>
            <p><strong>Parent partnership:</strong> Ongoing parent consults help support the child and reinforce progress at home.</p>

          <div class="subcard" id="collab-intro" aria-labelledby="collab-intro-heading">
              <h3 id="collab-intro-heading" class="section-title">What is Collaborative Divorce?</h3>
              <p>Collaborative Divorce is an out-of-court process where couples work together with a team of professionals to create a customized divorce agreement that meets the unique needs of their family. The focus is on respectful communication, cooperation, and minimizing emotional harm, especially for children.</p>
            <p>When couples decide to divorce, Texas options include:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li><strong>Kitchen Table settlement:</strong> informal agreement between spouses, possibly formalized later by an attorney.</li>
              <li><strong>Litigation:</strong> court-based process where a judge (or jury) makes final decisions.</li>
              <li><strong>Collaborative Divorce Process:</strong> out-of-court, private, respectful, and focused on minimizing emotional harm. A team often includes each spouse’s attorney, a neutral mental health professional, and a neutral financial professional. The couple remains in control of decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>Many families find the Collaborative Divorce process allows for healthier co-parenting and often results in less emotional harm and sometimes lower cost compared with litigation.</p>
