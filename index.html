                  <p>From a distance, mountains appear beautiful — strong, steady, and full of promise. But when we’re standing in the middle of them, the experience can feel very different. Up close, the climb can be exhausting. The path can feel unclear. And even though we try to appear confident, strong, and put-together, inside we may be overwhelmed, anxious, or hurting.</p>
                  <p>In many ways, life’s struggles and the weight of past trauma can feel just like that — like standing in a vast mountain range without a clear way through.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                      “Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill brought low; the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places smooth; the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.” Isaiah 40:4-5
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>If you’re feeling lost in the valley or weary from the climb, you don’t have to walk this path alone.</p>
                  <p>Hi, I’m Celeste. It would be an honor to walk alongside you or your child. Together, we can gently uncover the root of what you’re experiencing, process and heal from what has hurt you, and learn practical ways to manage overwhelming emotions. My hope is that over time, the mountain won’t feel quite so daunting — and that you’ll begin to see your own strength, resilience, and the beauty emerging from your journey.</p>
