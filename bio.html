          <div class="bio-body">
            <p>With over 20 years experience, Celeste Inman, MEd, LPC-S, RPT-S, brings both passion and expertise to her work with children, teens and adults. Her calling to support youth and families began early, leading her to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Child Development and Family Studies from the University of North Texas (UNT) in 2000, followed by a Master’s degree in Counseling from UNT in 2004.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Celeste is a Licensed Professional Counselor Supervisor, a Registered Play Therapist Supervisor and a Clinical Member of the Association for Play Therapy. Celeste began her career in 2003 at a domestic violence shelter in Dallas, Texas, where she gained extensive experience supporting survivors and their families through crisis, healing and rebuilding.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2008, Celeste moved to San Antonio and co-founded a thriving mental health private practice, which she helped build and manage for 17 years. While grateful for the season of leadership and growth, she felt called back to her deepest passion — direct client care — and opened her solo practice to more fully focus on meaningful therapeutic work with clients.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In addition to counseling, Celeste is trained in Collaborative Divorce work. Although trained as a Mental Health Professional, she especially values serving in the Child Specialist role, advocating for the voice and emotional needs of children during the divorce process.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Giving back to the community has always been important to Celeste. She has served on multiple boards including nextTalk, Collaborative Divorce of San Antonio, the Greater San Antonio Chapter of Texas Association for Play Therapy, and currently serves on the board of Positively Impacting Communities (PIC). Celeste has also provided many presentations, lectures, and workshops at different churches, schools, medical and teacher conferences, and has appeared as a guest on the nextTalk podcast.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Born and raised in San Antonio, Celeste is grateful to live, work, and serve in the community she calls home. She is married and a proud mom of two children.</p>
